# Langchain-Project
1. Questions and answer Chatbots:
   I've built chatbots and Question & Answer streamlit applications using powerful language models like GPT-3.5, Llama 3, Gemini-pro, and Mistral-7b within the Lamgchain framework. These applications are designed to answer user questions based on provided prompts and documents. The system utilizes a RAG pipeline to extract relevant information from the documents in response to user queries.
  
2. ATS System tracker using Gemini model:

  Leveraging the advanced capabilities of the Gemini model, we've developed an Applicant Tracking System (ATS) tracker streamlit application designed specifically for resume evaluation.
The ATS Tracker analyze resume and provide insightful feedback based on predefined prompts and criteria.
With gemini-pro-vision model, this Streamlit interface allow recruiters to effortlessly navigate through the resume evaluation process and make informed decisions.
